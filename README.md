### Streamlit & Pandas Version Conflicts
Streamlit will let you develop locally with the latest python (3.9.x) but can only host up to python 3.7.12. The latest pandas has moved on from python 3.7. All this is to say, please don't change the python and pandas versions specified in `pyproject.toml`.
