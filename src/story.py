        "Welcome to the town of [TOWN NAME], whose citizens are obsessed with all things avocado. They put them on their eggs in the morning, in their tacos midday, and transform them into guacamole for the evening. Everyone agrees that guacamole is the best use of the beloved avocado, but that’s about the only thing they can agree on. No one can agree whose guacamole recipe is the best, with most insisting it’s how their mama does it!",
        "Sensing an opportunity for some friendly competition, Mayor Michelada suggests the town hold a contest to settle once and for all who can make the best guac. Anyone who thinks their recipe is particularly special can bring a bowl of their best stuff to the town plaza this Sunday. The town will gather, try each one, and vote for the best! Everyone loves the idea. People immediately start signing up and texting their friends to do so too.",
        "That Sunday, the whole town – 250 people! – shows up for the contest. Everyone’s excited to get to spend the afternoon indulging in their favorite dip while playing food critic. The entrants, twenty three people with big bowls of their family’s pride and joy, gather in the center of the plaza.",

    "Guac God": [
        "Looking down from Horchata Heaven, you are the Guacamole God. You are so pleased that the beings of your creation have fallen for your favorite dip and also proud of their embrace of democratic values. And while you admire everyone’s hard work, since you are hors d'oeuvre omniscient, you can already clearly spot the winners.",
